# GearHub

GearHub is a e-commerce website where you can buy or sell PC parts. I started this project for learning and sharpening my web development skills. This is the backend for the project. For the frontend you can check out the [Frontend Repository][frontend-link]. If you want to contribute or have any suggestion you can contact me :>
